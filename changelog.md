## [2.2.0] Wild things

This release adds wildcard support to Tokenizer - well, kinda. Tokenizer is due to a rewrite, but is currently last in place on my backlog, right after the map creation of the D&D Beyond battlemaps and the Iconizer Icon-renaming party, so it will be a while. In the meantime, enjoy this little addition:

- Go to your _Prototype Token_ panel from your Actor's sheet.
- Go to _Image_
- Enable _Randomize Wildcard Images_
- No need to adjust the _Token Image Path_: If it does not yet contain a wildcard asterisk, Tokenizer will create an appropriate one for you based on the directory you defined as an Avatar/Token upload directory.

  Alternatively, you can specify a complete path containing an asterisk, which may deviate from your chosen setting, but make sure that it is pointing to your User Data storage pool, other storage pools are not supported

- Update Token, then open up Tokenizer
- You will see that the Token heading on the right has an added _(Wildcard)_ next to it - Wildcard-mode is enabled
- In the footer, next to the OK button, you will see the generated filename based on either your entry in _Token Image Path_ or the generated one: `Actorname.Token-[nnn].png`. All asterisks will be replaced by a 3-digit number.

Examples:

- Token Image Path: `uploads/my-token-*.png` -> `uploads/my-token-001.png`, `uploads/my-token-002.png`, `uploads/my-token-003.png`, ...
- Token Image Path: `my-token-*.png` -> `my-token-001.png`, `my-token-002.png`, `my-token-003.png`, ...
- Token Image Path: `uploads/my-*-token-*.png` -> `uploads/my-001-token-001.png`, `uploads/my-002-token-002.png`, `uploads/my-003-token-003.png`, ...

**FAQ**

- _When opening Tokenizer, the Token view is just black_ Since there might be not only one, but many Tokens already in place, just the default Token border is loaded each time you open up Tokenizer
- _How can I use that to batch-create Tokens?_ Open up Tokenizer as often as you'd like. The underlying design does not allow a better workflow, which might be implemented in the rewrite
- _What if I delete one token?_ The target filename is generated by querying the Foundry server for existing files matching the _Token Image Path_. It then counts up until it finds the next free number. So if you have 20 Tokens and delete No. '018', the next created token will have the number '018' to fill that slot, and will then continue to use '021' as the next free token.
- _Why can't I use S3?_ Support may be added on the rewrite, or when Foundry supports it in vanilla. This is not a promise.

### Fixed

- Existing Avatar images retain their original (squared) image dimensions they have, even after editing with Tokenizer. That means you can
  - Hold SHIFT while clicking on your Avatar image to upload an Avatar of your choice and or your desired resolution
  - After setting your Avatar image, click **again** on your Avatar, this time do not hold shift to open up Tokenizer
  - Your Avatar image area will have the dimensions of your original image, your Token image area will have the dimensions set in your game settings
